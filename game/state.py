"""``game.state`` — the stateful, multi-turn play surface (``game.md`` §3, the load-bearing new design).

The existing apps (``app.py``, ``app_making.py``, ``app_consequences.py``) are **stateless** what-if
panels: sliders in → readout out, nothing persists. A game is **stateful** — a live ``Heat`` evolving
across turns. Because :class:`~steel.heat_state.Heat` is a **frozen, append-only** dataclass (every
orchestrator step returns a *new* ``Heat`` with one :class:`~steel.heat_state.ProcessStep` appended), the
turn structure is clean and needs no new history machinery: **each turn = run one sealed stage on the
current ``Heat``, get a new ``Heat``, advance the cursor.** The provenance trail *is* the post-mortem,
already built — the game only drives the spine's existing one.

**Slice 1 — the gauntlet (``game.md`` §6, extended).** Slice 0 made the B2 capstone chain *playable* with
a single knob (the F2 blow endpoint); every other stage auto-ran a fixed recipe, so there was nothing else
to get wrong. Slice 1 makes **every stage a decision**: a :class:`Recipe` carries one knob per stage, each
field **defaulting to the capstone's reference value** (single-sourced from :mod:`steel.demo_capstone`).
A wrong choice **plants a latent flaw** in the live ``Heat`` (carbon off the window, oxygen the kill left
high, hydrogen the vacuum left in, sulfur the slag left, off-grade alloy) and the finished part is judged
by the **post-mortem** (:mod:`game.postmortem`) — the sealed consequence engines, run on the part, report
which defect each mistake became. You win by landing a sound, on-grade part; you lose by planting a defect.

**The golden-run invariant is preserved exactly.** The canonical ``Heat`` is built **only** from the eight
stage seams (the post-mortem reads the finished part, it never mutates the spine), and every ``Recipe``
field defaults to the reference value, so stepping the *reference* recipe reproduces
``demo_capstone.run_chain``'s sealed-engine verdict **exactly** — the golden-run test still pins that
equality, which *is* the proof the game adds no physics. ``play_to_end(c)`` is the one-knob Slice-0 view of
the same machine: ``Recipe(carbon=c)`` with every other knob at reference.

Pure logic: no streamlit, no matplotlib (the ``app.py`` three-layer firewall). The always-green tests pin
the turn structure (one ``ProcessStep`` per turn, immutable), the golden-run equality, and — the Slice-1
acceptance bar — **losability**: for every claimed knob there is a wrong setting that flips the verdict.

    golden-run equality holds. A field set away from its default is a **wrong call** that plants a latent
    flaw the post-mortem surfaces:

    * ``carbon`` — the F2 blow endpoint (wt %). Off the 4140 window → off-grade; far below → a soft core.
    * ``dephosphorize`` — run the basic converter slag, or skip it (tramp phosphorus stays → cold-short).
    * ``deoxidizer`` — the kill metal, ``"Al"`` / ``"Si"`` / ``"Mn"`` (the F1 Ellingham strength hierarchy
      Al ≫ Si > Mn). The strong aluminium kill drops dissolved oxygen far below the C–O line; a weak Si/Mn
      kill cannot, leaving the bath at the carbon-set oxygen → gas porosity at the cast.
    * ``degas_p_H2`` — the vacuum depth (atm H₂). A shallow vacuum leaves hydrogen → flaking.
    * ``desulfurize`` — run the reducing ladle slag, or skip it (tramp sulfur stays over the cleanliness
      spec — the trim's manganese still ties it as MnS, so it does **not** red-short, but it is off-spec).
    * ``carbon_pickup`` — trim with high-carbon ferroalloys that carry carbon into the bath (→ off-grade).
    * ``cast_modulus`` — the billet section modulus (m). **Not a losable knob on this grade**: it sets the
      Chvorinov time only (segregation is ``fs``-based, judged on the centerline, not the nominal part the
      verdict follows), so casting is an honest pass-through, kept here for golden-run fidelity.
