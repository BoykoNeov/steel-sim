"""Path integration: cooling curve → microstructure (Steel Phase 1c).

This is the steel-local **minimal path-integrator** (Steel plan §2 — kept here, not
promoted to ``engines/``, until a stabilized interface earns the rule-of-three).
It strings the isothermal laws of :mod:`kinetics` along a *continuous* cooling
curve ``T(t)`` and reports what the austenite becomes. Three pieces:

1. A **0-D lumped-capacitance cooler** — Newton cooling ``T(t)``, the analytic
   limit. (Phase 2 swaps in ``engines/diffusion`` heat mode for a *spatial*
   thermal field; this module's array-in/array-out boundary is where that slots.)
2. **Scheil additivity** ``∫dt/τ(T(t)) = 1`` — the rule that bridges the
   *isothermal* TTT curve to a *continuous-cooling* (CCT) transformation start.
3. The **fictitious-time additive integration** of the Avrami fraction along the
   path, then **Koistinen–Marburger** on whatever austenite survives to ``Mₛ``.

Why additivity works (and when it doesn't)
------------------------------------------
A continuously-cooled reaction is treated as a sum of infinitesimal isothermal
bites (Scheil 1935). Two equivalent uses appear here:

* **Start (incubation):** transformation begins when the *fractions of the local
  isothermal start-time consumed* add to one: ``∫₀ᵗ dt'/τ_X(T(t')) = 1`` with
  ``τ_X(T)`` the isothermal time to fraction ``X`` (:func:`additivity_start_time`).
  Held isothermally at ``T*`` the integral is just ``t/τ_X(T*)`` → it reaches 1 at
  ``t = τ_X(T*)``, recovering the isothermal curve. That reduction is the
  validation triad's consistency leg.
* **Amount:** the fraction itself is advanced by the **fictitious-time** method —
  at each step find the time ``t*`` that *would* have produced the current ``X`` at
  the current ``T`` (invert Avrami), advance ``t* + dt``, read the new ``X``
  (:func:`transform_along_path`).

Both are exact **only for an isokinetic reaction** (``Ẋ`` separable as
``f(X)·g(T)``), which is why :mod:`kinetics` holds the Avrami exponent ``n``
constant. A ``T``-dependent ``n`` would break additivity silently.

The martensite bookkeeping (why fractions sum to 1)
---------------------------------------------------
The diffusional path consumes a fraction ``X_diff`` of the austenite (split into
*pearlite* above ``Bs`` and *bainite* below it, by the temperature at which each
increment formed). Only the **retained** austenite ``(1 − X_diff)`` is then
available to shear to martensite, governed athermally by Koistinen–Marburger at
the **lowest temperature reached**. So

    pearlite + bainite + martensite + retained_austenite
      = X_diff + (1 − X_diff)·[f_KM + (1 − f_KM)]
      = X_diff + (1 − X_diff) = 1                       (exactly, by construction)

Applying KM to the *total* austenite instead would double-count and break this.

Units & I/O
-----------
Temperatures are **°C**, times **seconds**, fractions dimensionless ``[0,1]`` —
matching :mod:`kinetics`/:mod:`fe_c`. Cooling paths cross module boundaries as
**plain ``(t, T)`` arrays** (the array currency of ADR 0001 / Steel plan §5), not
live objects — the same seam a future spatial thermal history plugs into.
